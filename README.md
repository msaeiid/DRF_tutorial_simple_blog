## Features

The project covers the following key topics:

1. **Project Setup**  
   Learn how to set up a Django Rest Framework (DRF) project from scratch.
   
2. **API Views**  
   Create API views to interact with your models and handle HTTP requests.

3. **Database Models**  
   Define a model for blog posts, user accounts, and more.

4. **Serializers**  
   - Serialize model instances to JSON.
   - Deserialize JSON to model instances.
   - Implement model serializers for CRUD operations.

5. **Class-Based Views (CBV)**  
   Use CBVs to handle various HTTP methods more efficiently.

6. **Generic API Views & Mixins**  
   Utilize DRF's generic views and mixins to reduce repetitive code.

7. **ViewSets & Routers**  
   Group related views into a `ViewSet` and create URLs dynamically using routers.

8. **Custom User Authentication Model**  
   Create a custom user model to handle authentication and user creation.

9. **Token & JWT Authentication**  
   Implement token-based authentication and JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.

10. **Permission Classes**  
    Learn about permission classes and how to create custom permissions.

11. **Filtering and Pagination**  
    Apply filtering to API data and paginate large datasets.

12. **Unit Testing**  
    Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of your API.

13. **API Documentation**  
    Generate API documentation using **Swagger UI** and **Redoc**.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DRF_tutorial_simple_blog.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd DRF_tutorial_simple_blog
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      env\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source env/bin/activate
      ```

5. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Apply migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

7. Create a superuser:

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

8. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API through the provided endpoints. You can also log in to the Django admin panel by visiting:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
```

To interact with the API, use a tool like **Postman** or **cURL**.
